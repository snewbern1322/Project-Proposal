# Project-Proposal

Project Name of this project is "Coin Haven". And I (Steven Newbern) am doing this project solo. I will be building an interactive banking application that allows the user to create an account (username & password), add, transfer, and manage money. I will be using JavaFX as the GUI and a light weight database such as SQLite or H2 database to store and retrieve this information. I estimate that if I consistently put atleast two hours a day into coding and designing the application i can finish a few days before the due date (NOV 29).
